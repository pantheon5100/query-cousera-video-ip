# query-cousera-viedo-ip
To watch the video on cousera. You use the .py to query to the available ip address of cousera video.

Note: This file builds for Windows 10.

## Get available ip address
Run the QueryServer.py file and get the recommend ip address which will be printed on the last two lines. My python version is 3.7.7 and all modules used are built-in modules.

## Change host file
Add the text "RECOMMENDIP d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net" on the top of host file. In my case I added line "13.225.100.189    d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net". In general, host file is located in 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc'.

## Enjoy learning in Cousera!
